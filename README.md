# CodeAlpha – Data Visualization on Superstore Sales 

> ✅ Task 3 – Data Analytics Internship @ CodeAlpha

This project focuses on transforming Superstore sales data into meaningful, interactive, and insightful **visualizations** using Python's top plotting libraries. It demonstrates the power of **data storytelling** to uncover business trends, regional performance, and product-level profitability.

---

##  Task Objective (From CodeAlpha Guidelines)

- Transform raw data into visual formats like charts, graphs, and dashboards.
- Use tools like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, or **Tableau**.
- Design visuals that clearly reveal trends and patterns.
- Craft compelling data stories that support business decision-making.
- Build a portfolio with impactful, well-designed visualizations.

##  Dataset Overview

- **Dataset**: Superstore Sales Dataset (CSV)
- **Attributes**: Order Date, Region, Segment, Category, Sales, Profit, Quantity, State, Sub-Category, Ship Mode, etc.
- **Size**: ~10,000 rows

##  Key Visualizations

1. **Sales by Category** – Bar Plot  
2. **Profit by Sub-Category** – Horizontal Bar Chart  
3. **Sales vs Profit Scatter Plot** – with color-coded categories  
4. **Heatmap of Sales by Region and Segment**  
5. **Top 10 States by Sales** – Pie Chart  
6. **Monthly Sales Trend** – Line Plot with time series  
7. **Distribution of Discounts and Profit** – KDE & Boxplots  
8. **Quantity vs Discount Analysis**  
9. **Segment-wise Profit Comparison**  
10. **Ship Mode Usage Frequency** – Countplot  


##  Tools & Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas, Numpy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
